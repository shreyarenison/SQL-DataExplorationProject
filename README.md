# SQL - Data Exploration Project

## Project Overview

This project explores the **COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccinations dataset** from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) using **SQL**. The goal of the analysis is to uncover key insights related to the global impact of COVID-19, specifically focusing on:

- **Global and country-specific trends** in total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
- **Case fatality rates** (likelihood of dying if infected).
- **Infection rate vs. population** to identify the most affected regions.
- **Death count analysis** by country and continent.
- **Vaccination progress tracking** using **CTEs, temp tables, and views**.
- **Moving averages** to analyze trends in new cases over time.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation**: The dataset is cleaned and aggregated to extract meaningful trends.
- **SQL Techniques**: The project employs SQL features like **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, **temp tables**, and **views** to handle complex queries.
- **Advanced Metrics**: Includes calculations for infection rates, case fatality rates, and population vaccination percentages.
- **Visualization Preparation**: The project prepares the data for future visualizations to make it easier to understand the pandemic's impact.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (or other relational databases)
- **COVID-19 dataset** from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
